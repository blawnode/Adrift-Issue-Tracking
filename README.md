# Adrift-Issue-Tracking
A public issue tracker for our game, Adrift.

(Made by Blawnode, redsti, and NoStereo, in addition to past work from Nazsgull, KingKelpo and sound_digitator.)

## Want to suggest a change? A feature? Maybe report a bug?
Great! I'd be glad to hear here.

Instructions were not made yet, for how to make suggestions and reports, and our preferences. (It may be done some day?)

<br/>

The [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/f8VcqhrFFM) is not the right spot for issue tracking, but it's an okay place for small reports.

Rather, it's a spot for people interested in the game, its progress, news, perhaps people looking for competition?
